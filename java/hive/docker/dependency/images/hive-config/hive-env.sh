# Set Hive and Hadoop environment variables here. These variables can be used
# to control the execution of Hive. It should be used by admins to configure
# the Hive installation (so that users do not have to set environment variables
# or set command line parameters to get correct behavior).
#
# The hive service being invoked (CLI etc.) is available via the environment
# variable SERVICE


# Hive Client memory usage can be an issue if a large number of clients
# are running at the same time. The flags below have been useful in 
# reducing memory usage:
#
# if [ "$SERVICE" = "cli" ]; then
#   if [ -z "$DEBUG" ]; then
#     export HADOOP_OPTS="$HADOOP_OPTS -XX:NewRatio=12 -Xms10m -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=40 -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=15 -XX:+UseParNewGC -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit"
#   else
#     export HADOOP_OPTS="$HADOOP_OPTS -XX:NewRatio=12 -Xms10m -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=40 -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=15 -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit"
#   fi
# fi

# The heap size of the jvm stared by hive shell script can be controlled via:
#
# export HADOOP_HEAPSIZE=1024
#
# Larger heap size may be required when running queries over large number of files or partitions. 
# By default hive shell scripts use a heap size of 256 (MB).  Larger heap size would also be 
# appropriate for hive server.


# Set HADOOP_HOME to point to a specific hadoop install directory
# HADOOP_HOME=${bin}/../../hadoop

# Hive Configuration Directory can be controlled by:
# export HIVE_CONF_DIR=

# Folder containing extra libraries required for hive compilation/execution can be controlled by:
# export HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH=
