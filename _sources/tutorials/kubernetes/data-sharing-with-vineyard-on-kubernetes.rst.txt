Data sharing with Vineyard on Kubernetes 
========================================

If you want to share data between different workloads(pods or containers) on kubernetes, it's a good idea to
use vineyard as the data-sharing service. In this tutorial, we will show you how to
share data between different containers or pods on kubernetes step by step.

   Data sharing between containers

From the above figure, the `vineyardctl inject` command will inject vineyard container into the app pod and 
the app containers will connect to the vineyard container to share the vineyard data.

   Data sharing on the vineyard deployment

From the above figure, the `vineyardctl deploy vineyard-deployment` command will deploy a vineyard deployment
on the kubernetes cluster (default is 3 replicas) and the app pods will be scheduled to the vineyard deployment 
to share the vineyard data via the command `vineyardctl schedule workload`.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A kubernetes cluster >= v1.19.
- Install the latest vineyardctl command line tool refer to `vineyardctl installation`_.

Data sharing between different containers
-----------------------------------------

In this section, we will show you how to share data between different containers on kubernetes.
Assuming you have a pod with two containers, one is a producer and the other is a consumer.
The producer will generate some data and write it to vineyard, and the consumer will read the data
from vineyard and do some computation.

Save the following yaml as `pod.yaml`.

.. code:: yaml

    $ cat << EOF >> pod.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: vineyard-producer-consumer
      namespace: vineyard-test
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: producer
        image: python:3.10
        command:
        - bash
        - -c
        - |
          pip install vineyard numpy pandas;
          cat << EOF >> producer.py
          import vineyard;
          import numpy as np;
          import pandas as pd;
          client = vineyard.connect();
          # put a pandas dataframe to vineyard
          client.put(pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(100, 4), columns=list('ABCD')), persist=True, name="test_dataframe");
          # put a basic data unit to vineyard
          client.put((1, 1.2345, 'xxxxabcd'), persist=True, name="test_basic_data_unit");
          client.close()
          EOF
          python producer.py;
          sleep infinity;
      - name: consumer
        image: python:3.10
        command:
        - bash
        - -c
        - |
          # wait for the producer to finish
          sleep 10;
          pip install vineyard numpy pandas;
          cat << EOF >> consumer.py
          import vineyard;
          client = vineyard.connect();
          # get the pandas dataframe from vineyard
          print(client.get(name="test_dataframe").sum())
          # get the basic data unit from vineyard
          print(client.get(name="test_basic_data_unit"))
          client.close()
          EOF
          python consumer.py;
          sleep infinity;
    EOF

Use the `vineyardctl` to inject vineyard into the pod and apply them to the kubernetes cluster
as follows.

.. code:: bash

    # create the namespace
    $ kubectl create ns vineyard-test
    # get all injected resources
    $ python3 -m vineyard.ctl inject -f pod.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    pod/vineyard-sidecar-etcd-0 created
    service/vineyard-sidecar-etcd-0 created
    service/vineyard-sidecar-etcd-service created
    service/vineyard-sidecar-rpc created
    pod/vineyard-producer-consumer created


Then you can get the logs of the consumer containers as follows.

.. code:: bash

    # get the logs of the consumer container
    $ kubectl logs -f vineyard-producer-consumer -n test -c consumer
    A   -30.168469
    B   -19.269489
    C     6.332533
    D    -9.714950
    dtype: float64
    (1, 1.2345000505447388, 'xxxxabcd')

Data sharing between different pods
-----------------------------------

In this section, we will show you how to share data between different workloads on kubernetes.
You are supposed to create a vineyard deployment and then deploy the application pods on
the nodes where the vineyard deployment is running.

Deploy the vineyard deployment (default is 3 replicas) as follows.

.. code:: bash

    # create the namespace if not exists
    $ kubectl create ns vineyard-test
    # create the vineyard deployment
    $ python3 -m vineyard.ctl deploy vineyard-deployment --name vineyardd-sample -n vineyard-test
    2023-07-21T15:42:25.981+0800    INFO    vineyard cluster deployed successfully

Check the vineyard deployment status and the three vineyardd pods should run on the different nodes.

.. code:: bash

    # check the pods status
    $ kubectl get pod -lapp.vineyard.io/name=vineyardd-sample -n vineyard-test -owide
    NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP            NODE           NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
    vineyardd-sample-5fd45fdd66-fq55z   1/1     Running   0          3m37s   10.244.1.17   kind-worker3   <none>           <none>
    vineyardd-sample-5fd45fdd66-qjr5c   1/1     Running   0          3m37s   10.244.3.35   kind-worker    <none>           <none>
    vineyardd-sample-5fd45fdd66-ssqb7   1/1     Running   0          3m37s   10.244.2.29   kind-worker2   <none>           <none>
    vineyardd-sample-etcd-0             1/1     Running   0          3m53s   10.244.1.16   kind-worker3   <none>           <none>

Assume we have two pods, one is a producer and the other is a consumer. 

The producer yaml file is as follows.

.. code:: bash

    $ cat << EOF >> producer.yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: producer
      namespace: vineyard-test
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: producer
      replicas: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: producer
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: producer
            image: python:3.10
            command:
            - bash
            - -c
            - |
              pip install vineyard numpy pandas;
              cat << EOF >> producer.py
              import vineyard
              import numpy as np
              import pandas as pd
              client = vineyard.connect()
              client.put(pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(100, 4), columns=list('ABCD')), persist=True, name="test_dataframe")
              client.put((1, 1.2345, 'xxxxabcd'), persist=True, name="test_basic_data_unit");
              client.close()
              EOF
              python producer.py;
              sleep infinity;
    EOF

The consumer yaml file is as follows.

.. code:: bash

    $ cat << EOF >> consumer.yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: consumer
      namespace: vineyard-test
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: consumer
      replicas: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: consumer
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: consumer
            image: python:3.10
            command:
            - bash
            - -c
            - |
              pip install vineyard numpy pandas;
              cat << EOF >> consumer.py
              import vineyard
              client = vineyard.connect()
              dataframe_obj = client.get_name("test_dataframe")
              print(client.get(dataframe_obj,fetch=True).sum())
              unit_obj = client.get_name("test_basic_data_unit")
              print(client.get(unit_obj,fetch=True))
              client.close()
              EOF
              python consumer.py;
              sleep infinity;
    EOF

Use the `vineyardctl` to schedule the two workloads on the vineyard cluster.

.. code:: bash

    # schedule the producer workload to the vineyard cluster and apply it to the kubernetes cluster
    $ python3 -m vineyard.ctl schedule workload -f producer.yaml --vineyardd-name vineyardd-sample \
    --vineyardd-namespace vineyard-test -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    deployment.apps/producer created

    # schedule the consumer workload to the vineyard cluster and apply it to the kubernetes cluster
    $ python3 -m vineyard.ctl schedule workload -f consumer.yaml --vineyardd-name vineyardd-sample \
    --vineyardd-namespace vineyard-test -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    deployment.apps/consumer created

Check the logs of the consumer pods as follows.

.. code:: bash

    $ kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pod -lapp=consumer -n vineyard-test -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -n vineyard-test
    A    11.587912
    B    12.059792
    C     4.863514
    D    -2.682567
    dtype: float64
    (1, 1.2345000505447388, 'xxxxabcd')

From the above example, we can see the code of the consumer is quiet different from the previous sidecar example.
As the consumer may be scheduled to different node from the producer with the default kubernetes scheduler, the client
should get the remote object id by name and then fetch it from other vineyard nodes. For more details, please refer to
the `vineyard objects`_.
