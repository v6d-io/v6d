Machine learning with Vineyard on Kubernetes
--------------------------------------------

In this demonstration, we will build a fraudulent transaction classifier for
fraudulent transaction data. The process consists of the following
three main steps:

- :code:`prepare-data`: Utilize Vineyard to read and store data in a distributed manner.
- :code:`process-data`: Employ Mars to process the data across multiple nodes.
- :code:`train-data`: Use Pytorch to train the model on the distributed data.

We have three tables: user table, product table, and transaction table.
The user and product tables primarily contain user and product IDs, along with
their respective ``Feature`` vectors. Each record in the transaction table indicates
a user purchasing a product, with a ``Fraud`` label identifying whether the
transaction is fraudulent. Additional features related to these transactions are also
stored in the transaction table. You can find the three tables in the `dataset repo`_.
Follow the steps below to reproduce the demonstration. First, create a vineyard cluster
with 3 worker nodes.

.. code:: bash

    $ cd k8s && make -C k8s/test/e2e install-vineyard-cluster

First, let's prepare the dataset and download it into the kind worker nodes as follows.

.. code:: bash

    $ worker=($(docker ps | grep kind-worker | awk -F ' ' '{print $1}'))
    $ for c in ${worker[@]}; do \
        docker exec $c sh -c "\
            mkdir -p /datasets; \
            cd /datasets/; \
            curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GraphScope/gstest/master/vineyard-mars-showcase-dataset/{item,txn,user}.csv" \
      done

The `prepare-data` job primarily reads the datasets and distributes them across different
Vineyard nodes. For more information, please refer to the `prepare data code`_. To apply
the job, follow the steps below:

.. note::

    The `prepare-data` job needs to exec into the other pods. Therefore, you need to
    create a service account and bind it to the role under the namespace.
    Please make sure you can have permission to create the following role.

    .. code:: text

      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods", "pods/log", "pods/exec"]
        verbs: ["get", "patch", "delete", "create", "watch", "list"]

.. code:: bash

    $ kubectl create ns vineyard-job && \
    kubectl apply -f showcase/vineyard-mars-pytorch/prepare-data/resources && \
    kubectl wait job -n vineyard-job -l app=prepare-data --for condition=complete --timeout=1200s

.. admonition:: Expected output

        job.batch/prepare-data condition met

.. note::

    The `process-data` job needs to create a new namespace and deploy several kubernetes 
    resources in it. Please make sure you can have permission to create the following role.

    .. code:: text

        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["pods", "pods/exec", "pods/log", "endpoints", "services"]
          verbs: ["get", "patch", "delete", "create", "watch", "list"]
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["namespaces"]
          verbs: ["get", "create", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["nodes"]
          verbs: ["get", "list"]
        - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
          resources: ["roles", "rolebindings"]
          verbs: ["patch", "get", "create", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: ["apps"]
          resources: ["deployments"]
          verbs: ["create"]

    Notice, the `process-data` job will require lots of permissions to deal 
    kubernetes resources, so please check the image of `process-data` job 
    if it is an official one.

The `prepare-data` job creates numerous dataframes in Vineyard. To combine these dataframes,
we use the appropriate join method in `mars`_. For more details, refer to the `process data
code`_. Apply the `process-data` job as follows:

.. code:: bash

    $ kubectl apply -f showcase/vineyard-mars-pytorch/process-data/resources && \
      kubectl wait job -n vineyard-job -l app=process-data --for condition=complete --timeout=1200s

Finally, apply the `train-data` job to obtain the fraudulent transaction classifier. You can
also view the `train data code`_.

.. code:: bash

    $ kubectl apply -f k8s/showcase/vineyard-mars-pytorch/train-data/resources && \
      kubectl wait pods -n vineyard-job -l app=train-data --for condition=Ready --timeout=1200s

If any of the above steps fail, please refer to the `mars showcase e2e test`_ for further guidance.
