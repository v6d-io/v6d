   Architecture of Vineyard

Server side
^^^^^^^^^^^

On the server (daemon) side (i.e., the aforementioned Vineyard instance), there are
three primary components:

1. The **shared memory** is the memory space in Vineyard that is shared with Vineyard
   clients via the UNIX domain socket through memory mapping.

   As previously mentioned, the partitions of the distributed data reside in the
   shared memory of the corresponding Vineyard instance in the cluster.

2. The **metadata manager** is responsible for managing the metadata of the data stored
   in Vineyard.

   The metadata manager maintains the metadata (structures, layouts, and properties) of
   the data to provide high-level abstractions (e.g., graphs, tensors, dataframes).
   The metadata managers in a Vineyard cluster communicate with each other through
   the backend key-value store, such as etcd server, to ensure the consistency of the
   distributed data stored in Vineyard.

3. The **IPC/RPC servers** manage the IPC/RPC connections from Vineyard
   clients for data sharing.

   Specifically, the client can retrieve both metadata and data partitions stored in
   Vineyard via IPC and RPC connections. However, when both connection types are available,
   IPC connections are prioritized due to the greater efficiency of memory mapping for data
   sharing.

.. _client-side:

Client side
^^^^^^^^^^^

On the client side, the core component is the **Vineyard client**. The client side
includes both low-level APIs for accessing Vineyard instances in a precise
manner and high-level APIs for data structure sharing, manipulation, and
routine reuse (e.g., I/O drivers). More specifically,

1. The **IPC client** communicates with *local* Vineyard instances by connecting
   to the UNIX domain socket.

   The IPC client is used to establish an IPC connection between the Vineyard server and
   the client, enabling memory-sharing (by :code:`mmap` and transferring the file descriptor)
   between the Vineyard server and the computing engines.

2. The **RPC client** communicates with *remote* Vineyard instances by connecting
   to the TCP port that the Vineyard daemon is bound to.

   Unlike the IPC client, the RPC client doesn't allow memory sharing between processes
   and is less efficient in that regard. However, it is still useful for retrieving both
   metadata and payloads from the Vineyard cluster via TCP or RDMA.

3. The **builders and resolvers** for out-of-the-box high-level data abstractions
   offer a convenient way for applications to consume objects in Vineyard and
   produce result objects into Vineyard.

   The builders and resolvers adopt an extensible design where users can register
   their own builders and resolvers for their newly defined data types, as well as
   new builders and resolvers that build ad-hoc engine-specific data structures
   as Vineyard objects and wrap Vineyard objects as engine-specific data types
   at a low cost.

   The builders, resolvers, and the registry are part of the language-specific
   SDKs of Vineyard. Currently, Python and C++ are officially supported, and the Rust
   and Go SDKs are under heavy development.

4. The **pluggable drivers** assign specific functionalities to certain types of data
   in Vineyard.

   In particular, I/O drivers synchronize with external storages such as databases and file
   systems to read data into and write data from Vineyard, while partition and
   re-partition drivers reorganize the distributed graphs stored in Vineyard to
   balance the workload.

   .. note::

       The drivers typically employ the low-level APIs for precise operations.

5. **Object migration** is the mechanism implemented on the client side to
   migrate objects between Vineyard instances in a cluster. Object migration
   is usually needed when the computing engines cannot be scheduled to co-locate
   with the data required by the jobs.

   Object migration is implemented on the client side as a process pair where the
   sender and receiver are both connected to (different) Vineyard instances and
   communicate with each other using TCP to move objects between Vineyard instances.
   We don't put the object migration on the server side to decouple the functionalities
   and allow users to register a more efficient object migration implemented on
   their own deployment infrastructures, e.g.,leveraging RDMA and other high-performance
   network technologies.

Core features
-------------

Zero-cost in-memory data sharing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vineyard provides zero-cost data sharing through memory-mapping, as data objects
in Vineyard are immutable. When an object is created, we allocate blobs in
Vineyard to store the data payload. On the other hand, when retrieving the object,
we map the blob from the Vineyard instance into the application process using
inter-process memory mapping techniques, ensuring that no memory copy is involved
in sharing the data payload.

Distributed data sharing in big data tasks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By examining the practices of big data tasks such as numeric computing, machine learning,
and graph analysis, we have identified four key properties of the data involved:

+ Distributed and each partitioned fragment usually fits into memory;
+ Immutable, i.e., never modified after creation;
+ With complex structure, e.g., graph in CSR format;
+ Required to share between different computation systems and programming languages.

Vineyard is designed to address these challenges with:

+ Composable design for Vineyard objects;
+ Immutable zero-cost in-memory data sharing via memory mapping;
+ Out-of-the-box high-level data abstraction for complex data structures;
+ Extensible design for builder/resolver/driver, enabling flexible cross-system and
  cross-language data sharing.

In general, Vineyard's design choices are fully determined by addressing
the difficulties in handling large-scale distributed data in practice.

Out-of-the-box high-level data abstraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vineyard objects are stored with structures and high-level abstractions.
For instance, a graph with CSR format in Vineyard stores the index along with
the vertices and edges, enabling operations like edge iteration based on the
index. This means users don't have to implement the index-building
function and edge iterators themselves, which is often required in
existing big data practices.

Convenient data integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The extensible design of builder/resolver/driver allows for convenient extension
of existing Vineyard objects to different programming languages. Moreover,
with codegen tools in Vineyard, users can easily transplant their
data structures into Vineyard with only a few annotations.

Data orchestration in a Python notebook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using Vineyard as the common data orchestration engine throughout the end-to-end
big data processing, users can hold large-scale distributed data as variables
of Vineyard objects in Python. As long as the computation modules
involved provide Python APIs, users can write down the entire processing
pipeline in a Python notebook. By running the Python script, users can
manage trillions of data and different computation systems in the background
distributedly across the cluster.

Non-goals and limitations
-------------------------

*NO* mutable objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a Vineyard object is created and sealed in the Vineyard instance, it
becomes immutable and can NOT be modified anymore. Thus, Vineyard is not
suitable for use as a data cache to store mutable data that changes
rapidly along the processing pipeline.
